<em>Assistant Professor at the Department of Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution</em>

Dr. Asadi's research interests encompass scalable processing/manufacturing of hybrid (micro/nano) composites with enhanced properties, additive manufacturing of strong hybrid polymer composites and fabricating biomedical polymer nanocomposites. He is especially interested in understanding underlying mechanisms at multiple length-scales to understand the formation of microstructure and interphase in hierarchical structures in order to develop capabilities to engineer the desired properties in composites.  In addition, he is interested in using cellulose nanomaterials along with other nanoparticles to provide scalable and sustainable solutions for composites with enhanced properties.

<strong>PhD Student</strong>

Shadi started her PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University in Summer 2018. Her research is focused on engineering the bottom-up fabrication of functional multi-material nanostructures that are created through evaporation induced self-assembly of nanocolloidal droplets. She has developed a novel atomization system for targeted delivery of nanoparticle carrier droplets, and the goal is to engineer the self-assembly of nano-colloids within each droplet to achieve the desired shape and properties in the final deposited nanostructure. Some of the main applications of this process that she has studied are delivering and tailoring the formation of Nanostructures in 3D printing, functional coatings, and electronics manufacturing. Shadi obtained her Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Houston in 2016.

Shadi will defend her PhD in October 2021 and will start her new role as product engineer at Amazon in Jan. 2022.
